 --Here are two exercises to help you explore concepts related to databases, tables, and
 --data relationships:
 --Imagine youâ€™re building a database to catalog all the animals at your local zoo. You
 --want one table to track the kinds of animals in the collection and another table to track
 --the specifics on each animal. Write CREATE TABLE statements for each table that include
 --some of the columns you need. Why did you include the columns you chose?
 --Now create INSERT statements to load sample data into the tables. How can you view
 --the data via the pgAdmin tool? Create an additional INSERT statement for one of your
 --tables. Purposely omit one of the required commas separating the entries in the VALUES
 --clause of the query. What is the error message? Would it help you find the error in the
 --code?


SELECT * FROM  public.zoo
